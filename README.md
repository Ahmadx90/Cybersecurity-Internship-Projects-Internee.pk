# Cybersecurity-Internship-Projects-Internee.pk
CThis repository contains all the projects I worked on during my two-month cybersecurity internship at [internee.pk](https://www.internee.pk/) . These projects focus on endpoint security, cloud security, authentication systems, incident response planning, and security awareness testing to strengthen enterprise security posture.

**Projects Overview**

1.	Implement Endpoint Security & Monitoring
•	Deployed EDR solutions (Wazuh + Sysmon) for real-time threat detection and monitoring.

2.	Secure Cloud Infrastructure
•	Implemented cloud hardening measures, IAM policies, and encryption for secure deployments.

3.	Set Up a Secure User Authentication System
•	Configured MFA and IAM controls for enhanced user authentication security.

4.	Create a Secure File Sharing System
•	Designed encrypted file-sharing workflows to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

5.	Design a Cyber Incident Response Plan
•	Built an IR plan aligned with NIST standards for structured incident handling.

6.	Security Audit of Internee.pk’s Website
•	Conducted vulnerability assessments, identified OWASP Top 10 issues, and suggested fixes.

7.	Conduct a Phishing Simulation
•	Simulated phishing attacks to measure employee awareness and improve defense posture.
